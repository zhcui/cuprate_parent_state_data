AFM state examples are provided, FM and SDW states are similar by changing the underlying mean-field.

To run:
1. first generate integrals and run HF.
2. after HF is finished, run DMET code.

rdm1_glob_lo_k.npy stores the reduced 1-particle density matrices.
it can be load via numpy.load, and has shape (2, nkpts, norb, norb).
where nkpts is the number of kpoints and norb is the number of embedding orbitals.
Among the norb orbitals, the first nimp is the impurity orbitals, the remaining are bath orbitals.
The orbital order is the same as the order in the population.
